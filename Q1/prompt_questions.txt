therefore, I need you to carefully extract the following key information:

1.Customer's Full Name: identify and Generate the customer's full name from a transcript, only consider it valid if explicitly mentioned.

Do not make guesses based on indirect references. When a full name is not provided, reply with 'Unspecified'.
Exercise caution in your reply, as the mentioned name may carry associated or irrelevant details, example for those mistakes:
1. Customer's Full Name: "Jhon sister Anna", this is a mistake because "Jhon sister" it's a relation and not relevant information, the correct answer should be:  1. Customer's Full Name: 'Unspecified'
1. Customer's Full Name: "Anna", this is a mistake because it's only the first name of the customer, the correct answer should be:  1. Customer's Full Name: 'Unspecified'
